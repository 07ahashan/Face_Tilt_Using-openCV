In this project, we are going to see how to determine the face tilt using OpenCV in Python.

To achieve this we will be using a popular computer vision library opencv-python.
In this program with the help of the OpenCV library, we will detect faces in a live stream from a webcam or a video file and subsequently also determine the angle by how much the face is tilted.

Basic requirement:
1 Jupyter NoteBook/ VSCode / pyCharm
2 Install open-CV for python
3 Trained DataSet:
    Classifier for face detection: haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml(it is avail in the file)
    Classifier for eye detection: haarcascade_eye.xml(it is avail in the file)
4 Algorithm that calculate the Angle:
      For computing the angle of tilt we will assume that the line joining the centers of two eyes is perpendicular to the face.
      We have the coordinates of two centers in terms of (x,y) coordinates. The x-axis is the horizontal axis and y-axis is the vertical axis.
      When two points are given (x_{1}, y_{1})       & (x_{2},y_{2})      , the angle \theta      
      which the line joining the two points makes with the x-axis can be obtained from geometry using the following expression:
      \theta = \arctan(\frac{x_2 - x_1}{y_2 - y_1})

      In our case, the angle made by the line joining the centers of two eyes with the horizontal is computed.
      The positive angle indicates the right tilt and the negative angle indicates the left tilt.
      Provided a margin of error of 10 degrees (i.e, if the face tilts more than 10 degrees on either side the program will classify as right or left tilt).
